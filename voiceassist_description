# 2. Voice Assistant

This project is a simple voice assistant application using Python, which utilizes various libraries to perform voice recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and provide responses to user commands.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` library to recognize voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Uses `pyttsx3` library to convert text to speech.
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieves summary from Wikipedia for a given query.
- **Web Browsing**: Opens YouTube and Google based on voice commands.
- **Current Time**: Tells the current time.
- **Music Playback**: Opens Spotify to play music.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter`
- `pyttsx3`
- `speech_recognition`
- `wikipedia`
- `webbrowser`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant.git
    cd voice-assistant
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `voiceassist.py` script:
    ```bash
    python voiceassist.py
    ```

2. Use the graphical interface to start and stop the voice assistant. The assistant will listen to your commands and respond accordingly.

## How It Works

- **Speech Recognition**: The `speech_recognition` library captures the user's voice input and converts it into text.
- **Processing Commands**: The recognized text is processed to identify the command and perform the corresponding action.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The `pyttsx3` library converts the response text back into speech.

## Functions

- `speak(text)`: Converts text to speech.
- `greet()`: Greets the user based on the time of the day.
- `take_command()`: Listens to the user's voice command and processes it.
- `stop_listening()`: Stops the assistant and quits the application.
- `process_query(query)`: Processes the recognized text to perform actions like Wikipedia search, opening web pages, telling time, and playing music.
- `clear_text()`: Clears the text display in the interface.

## Graphical Interface

The application uses `tkinter` to create a simple graphical interface with the following components:
- **Label**: Displays the title and status of the assistant.
- **Text Display**: Shows the results of the commands.
- **Buttons**: Start Listening, Stop Listening, and Clear Text.
